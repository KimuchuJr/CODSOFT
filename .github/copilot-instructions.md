# Copilot Instructions for CODSOFT Workspace

This workspace contains multiple UI/UX and web design tasks, each in its own directory. AI coding agents should follow these guidelines to be productive and consistent:

## Architecture Overview
- The workspace is organized by task: `TASK_1`, `TASK_2`, etc., and a parallel set under `UXUI/` for UI/UX-focused versions.
- Each task directory contains a `README.md` describing the design goals, user experience principles, and requirements for that task.
- HTML files (e.g., `et.html`) are present for prototyping or template work. There is no backend or build system detected; focus is on static web design and documentation.

## Key Patterns & Conventions
- **Design Principles:** Each README emphasizes visual appeal, ease of use, clear navigation, and consistency. Follow these principles in all UI/UX work.
- **Task Structure:** Keep all files for a given task within its directory. For example, updates to `TASK_2` should be made in `TASK_2/` and/or `UXUI/TASK_2/`.
- **Documentation:** Update the relevant `README.md` with any changes to design, workflow, or user experience. Use concise, user-focused language.
- **Naming:** Use clear, descriptive filenames for new assets. Match the naming conventions already present (e.g., `et.html`).

## Developer Workflows
- No build, test, or deployment scripts are present. All work is manual and file-based.
- To preview HTML, open files directly in a browser. No special commands or tools are required.
- If adding new tasks, follow the existing folder and documentation structure.

## Integration & Dependencies
- No external dependencies or package managers are detected. All code should be self-contained and portable.
- If referencing external assets (images, fonts), ensure they are included in the task directory or linked via CDN.

## Examples
- For a new e-commerce page, follow the structure and principles in `TASK_4/README.md` and `UXUI/TASK_4/README.md`.
- For a signup flow, see `UXUI/TASK_1/README.md` for best practices.

## Summary
- Focus on clarity, usability, and visual design.
- Keep all changes scoped to the relevant task directory.
- Document all design decisions in the appropriate `README.md`.
- No backend, build, or test automation is presentâ€”work is static and manual.

For questions or unclear conventions, review the relevant `README.md` or ask for clarification.
